# Progress tracker
---
A simple, open-source TODO list and progress tracker for windows, macOS and Linux. Built using tauri and svelte.

## Features

### Nested Tasks.
A task may optionally be comprised of smaller, simpler tasks.

### Weights.
Each task has a weight assigned to it. A heavier task will advance the progress bar more when completed.

### Automatic video weights.
Automatically create a TODO list based on the duration of videos in your filesystem.
