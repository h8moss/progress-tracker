## üåü Features

### üìä Nested and slider tasks
Organize your work with hierarchical task structures. Break down complex projects into manageable subtasks and keep exact progress on each of them.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Task Weights
Assign importance to your tasks. Heavier tasks contribute more to your overall progress.

### üî¢ Weight Interpretation
Weights can be interpreted and rendered as different units, making it easier to understand task importance in various contexts.

### üé• Automatic Video Weights
Create TODO lists based on video durations in your filesystem. (Thanks to [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html))

### üé® Custom Themes
Personalize your experience with custom color schemes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### System Requirements
- 2 GB RAM

## üì• Installation

### Windows
1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/h8moss/progress-tracker/releases) on GitHub.
2. Download the latest version of the application.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

### Building for source (Windows, Linux and MacOS)
> [!WARNING]
> The application has only been tested on Windows and was designed with Windows in mind. It may or may not work correctly on other systems.
> 
> There are currently no official releases for Linux or MacOS. However, if there's sufficient user interest in testing and bug reporting, we may consider creating official releases for these platforms in the future.

1. Install dependencies
    Check tauri's [prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) and follow the instructions. You will need to install NodeJS, Rust, and a few other platform-dependent dependencies.

2. Download ffmpeg from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/h8moss/progress-tracker
   cd progress-tracker
   ```
4. Get your current target's triple by running this command:
    ```
    rustc -Vv | Select-String "host:" | ForEach-Object {$_.Line.split(" ")[1]}
    ```
    or on linux/macOS:
    ```
    rustc -Vv | grep host | cut -f2 -d' '
    ```
    Remember this value for next step

5. Move ffprobe from the bin folder in ffmpeg to
    `path/to/progress-tracker/src-tauri/binaries`
    and rename it to:
    `ffprobe-{TARGET TRIPLE FROM PREVIOUS STEP}`

6. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

7. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I sync my tasks across multiple devices?**
A: Progress Tracker is, and will always remain, a fully offline application, we will never send your tasks over to a server, that being said, you can use an application like [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to keep your files perpetually synced across devices

**Q: Is there a mobile version available?**
A: Absolutely no!!!! This is something that we do not have planned as it would require a full rewrite of the application

**Q: How can I report a bug or request a feature?**
A: Please use our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/h8moss/progress-tracker/issues) page to report bugs or suggest new features.
