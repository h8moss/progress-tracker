## üåü Features

### üìä Nested Tasks
Organize your work with hierarchical task structures. Break down complex projects into manageable subtasks.

![Nested Tasks Demo](https://github.com/h8moss/progress-tracker/assets/43828996/8caff440-8763-409a-b100-11ae87fd14fd)

### ‚öñÔ∏è Task Weights
Assign importance to your tasks. Heavier tasks contribute more to your overall progress.

Weights can be interpreted and rendered as different units, making it easier to understand task importance in various contexts.
